# Reapplies the apt holds this port depends on. Run as root on the phone.
#
# Nothing here is owned by a package, so apt cannot delete our files; dpkg only
# removes what is in its own manifest. The risk these holds address is
# behavioural, not deletion:
#
#   alsa-ucm-conf   the UCM lookup path and syntax our config relies on
#   alsa-utils      alsa-restore, the fallback that puts the route back at boot
#   pipewire/spa    a major version could change the conf.d rule format; if our
#                   rule stops applying, ACP comes back, and because the PCMs
#                   cannot be opened without a route, PipeWire fails to start
#                   and the machine has no audio at all
#   wireplumber     same reasoning
#   gstreamer1.0-pipewire
#                   the only route from GStreamer to PipeWire. Most recording
#                   applications, the GNOME sound recorder included, capture
#                   through GStreamer, so without this plugin the microphone is
#                   fine at every level this port controls and every app still
#                   records silence
#   kali-menu       owns /usr/share/kali-menu/exec-in-shell, which hundreds of
#                   Kali menu launchers call; without it they fail with "could
#                   not find the program". See userspace/plasma-apps.
#   libspa-0.2-bluetooth
#                   the PipeWire plugin that actually carries Bluetooth audio.
#                   pipewire is pinned at 1.6.8 above, and this ships a plugin
#                   built against that exact SPA ABI, so letting it move on its
#                   own is the most likely way to end up with earbuds that pair
#                   and connect and then play nothing
#   bluez           bluetoothd, bluetoothctl and btmgmt. btmgmt is what
#                   rhodep-bt-address uses to program the controller's real
#                   address at every boot; without it the phone goes back to a
#                   random one per boot and every pairing dies. Note this one
#                   is a network-facing daemon with a CVE history, so it is the
#                   hold most worth lifting deliberately when an update matters:
#                   rhodep-hold-override release bluez "<reason>"
#   libqrtr-dev     needed to rebuild the memshare responder in userspace/modem;
#                   losing it does not stop the installed binary from running,
#                   but it does stop anyone from rebuilding it
#   squeekboard     the on screen keyboard once KWin is pointed at it, and the
#                   only one here with a terminal layout; losing it on a phone
#                   means losing text input entirely
#   plasma-keyboard kept installed purely as the fallback to switch back to
#   neard           the NCI daemon the NFC reader drives the S3NRN4V through;
#                   not installed by default and the whole userspace/nfc path
#                   depends on it. See nice-to-have 10 and userspace/nfc.
#   wlr-randr       the Wayland output tool the NFC bring-up leaned on; held
#                   alongside neard so the NFC work does not regress on an
#                   upgrade. Both are behavioural holds, not deletion.
#
# The modem, wifi, kernel and firmware holds predate audio and are kept.
#
# Deliberately NOT held: python3, which rhodep-jack-watch needs. Pinning the
# interpreter of a rolling distribution to keep one small script working would
# block security updates and hold back half the system, which is a much worse
# trade than the script breaking loudly and visibly.

# --- the port's own .debs, which a hold does NOT fully cover ------------------
# rhodep-battery-jeita, rhodep-modem-support, rhodep-usb-otg and rhodep-gnss are
# built here and exist only in /var/lib/dpkg/status: no repo, no cached archive.
# apt says so outright --
#
#	# apt-get install --reinstall rhodep-battery-jeita
#	Reinstallation of rhodep-battery-jeita is not possible, it cannot be downloaded.
#
# -- so while the hold stops an upgrade and dpkg's Protected stops the package
# being removed, nothing at all stops `rm` of one of their files, and there is
# nowhere to restore it from. Losing /usr/local/sbin/rhodep-battery-jeita means
# losing the below-0C charge cutoff, permanently and silently, on a package
# that still looks installed, held and protected.
#
# So these get the file layer as well. The cost is that `dpkg -i` of a newer
# version of one of these packages fails on the immutable files and needs a
# `rhodep-protect-files release` first -- the same friction as the DKMS
# drivers, for the same reason. Distro packages are deliberately NOT treated
# this way: apt can always re-fetch those, so immutability would only break
# their upgrades.
#
# register skips paths that do not exist, so this is safe when a package is not
# installed. The multi-user.target.wants/* entries are symlinks and are left
# out on purpose: the store keeps a content snapshot, and restoring a symlink
# from one would replace it with a copy of its target.
