# Modem support for motorola-rhodep. Run as root on the phone, or in the build
# chroot (nothing here touches the hardware at install time).
#
# Five pieces, see README.md and HANDOFF-SESSION4.md session 14 for why:
#
#   1. rhodep-rfs-populate  copies the modem's remote file system out of the
#      stock modem/fsg/persist partitions at first boot. This is what actually
#      makes the radio come up: without image/modem_pr/so/*.mbn the modem sat
#      in DMS operating mode 'offline' and refused every mode transition.
#   1b. rhodep-uim-provision opens the primary GW provisioning session, without
#      which the SIM stops at 'detected' and ModemManager says sim-missing.
#   2. a patched tqftpserv that also serves /readonly/vendor/fsg/, installed
#      alongside the distro one so the apt hold on tqftpserv stays valid.
#   3. the memshare responder (QMI service 52), which the modem asks for during
#      bring-up. Not the blocker, but the right thing to answer.
#   4. rhodep-ipa-hold.conf, which keeps ipa.ko out of the boot. TEMPORARY, and
#      the one thing between this port and working mobile data. Read the file.

# A minimal chroot may not have these yet, and cc -o would fail on the path
# rather than on the compile, which is a confusing way to find out.
install -d /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin

# A previous run may have made these immutable (see userspace/apt: nothing in
# dpkg owns them, so nothing else would ever put them back). Clear that before
# overwriting; re-registered at the end.

#   - resolves /readonly/vendor/fsg/ (the modem asks for mcfg_sw/mbn_sw.dig
#     there; upstream rejects the path),
#   - serves /shared/, /hlos/ and /ramdumps/, the other three roots of a
#     Qualcomm RFS namespace, all three of which this modem's firmware names
#     literally and upstream answers "invalid path" to,
#   - can publish QMI service 4096 on more than one RFS instance.
#
# -i 6 is stock's /vendor/rfs/apq/gnss, the positioning subsystem's own remote
# file system root. Stock's tftp_server publishes instances 1..12; upstream
# publishes only 1 (msm/mpss), and qrtr-ns matches instances exactly, so a
# client looking up any other one finds no server and tqftpserv never sees the
# request. Instance 6 costs one idle socket. See userspace/modem/README.md.

# -d keeps a record of every file the modem asks for, which is how the missing
