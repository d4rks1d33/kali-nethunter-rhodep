# pwnagotchi on rhodep

	git clone https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi /opt/pwnagotchi   # if not already there
	# install the aarch64 pwngrid from jayofelony/pwngrid releases to /usr/bin/pwngrid
	sudo ./install.sh
	otg on
	sudo systemctl start rhodep-pwnagotchi

Then the web UI is at `http://<phone>:8080` (or `172.16.42.1:8080` over the USB
cable). It captures WPA handshakes into `/etc/pwnagotchi/handshakes/`.

Verified working on the device: bettercap on `wlan1mon` sees dozens of APs, the
agent sends association/deauth frames and **captured 11 handshakes** in a short
auto-mode run, e.g.

	!!! captured new handshake on channel 1: b2:4e:26:df:2b:2f -> Claro Fibra !!!

## The one thing that matters: it uses wlan1, never wlan0

pwnagotchi is built for a Raspberry Pi whose only WiFi does monitor mode. This
phone is the opposite:

- **wlan0** is the internal ath10k / WCN3990. It is the only real WiFi and
  **cannot do monitor mode at all** — the firmware reports `raw 0` — so it has
  to stay a managed client (that is your actual network).
- **wlan1** is the external TP-Link TL-WN722N (RTL8188EUS), which does monitor
  and injection. All capture happens here.

So everything is pinned to wlan1 and wlan0 is never touched:

- `main.iface = "wlan1mon"` in the config — a distinct name, impossible to
  confuse with wlan0.
- `rhodep-pwn-monstart` operates on **wlan1 by name only**, refuses to run if
  pointed at wlan0, and refuses if wlan1 turns out to share a phy with wlan0.
- It **never runs `airmon-ng check kill`**. Upstream's monstart does, which
  stops NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant for the whole system — on this phone
  that would drop wlan0 and gain nothing, since NetworkManager already ignores
  wlan1. Instead it hands only wlan1 to `nmcli device set wlan1 managed no`,
  with no daemon restart.
- It removes the driver's stray P2P-device vif, but only ones on wlan1's phy,
  and explicitly skips wlan0.

Confirmed after a full run: `wlan0` stayed `type managed` and connected
throughout, `nmcli` still showed `wlan0:connected`.

## Pieces

	bin/rhodep-pwn-monstart            wlan1 -> monitor as wlan1mon (wlan1 only)
	bin/rhodep-pwn-monstop             wlan1mon -> managed
	bin/rhodep-pwn-bettercap-launcher  bettercap on wlan1mon (main.mon_start_cmd path)
	bin/rhodep-pwn-launcher            the agent, from the venv
	config/config.toml                 the user override
	apply-ui-fixes.sh                  web-UI patches to /opt/pwnagotchi (idempotent)
	systemd/rhodep-pwn-bettercap.service   bettercap + api.rest on :8081
	systemd/rhodep-pwngrid-peer.service    pwngrid peer on wlan1mon
	systemd/rhodep-pwnagotchi.service      the agent (pulls in the other two)

## How it runs

Three services, same split as upstream but retargeted:

1. **bettercap** brings up `wlan1mon` (via monstart) and serves its REST API on
   `127.0.0.1:8081`. This is what actually drives the radio.
2. **pwngrid-peer** is the identity/mesh peer, on `wlan1mon`, API on `:8666`.
   `grid.report = false` in the config keeps it from phoning home.
3. **pwnagotchi** is the agent: it talks to bettercap's API, sets
   `wifi.interface wlan1mon`, and runs the recon/associate/deauth/capture loop.

Stopping is the important direction: bettercap's `ExecStopPost` runs
`rhodep-pwn-monstop`, which renames `wlan1mon` back to `wlan1`, sets it managed
and hands it to NetworkManager — so after an off there is a normal `wlan1`
again, by name and mode, and wlan0 was never touched. Verified: start -> stop
leaves `wlan1 type managed`, no `wlan1mon`, `wlan0` still connected.

It runs from a venv at `/opt/pwnagotchi/.venv` built `--system-site-packages`,
because Kali is EXTERNALLY-MANAGED: scapy, flask, dbus, prctl and the rest come
from apt, and only `pycryptodome` (the `Crypto` module) is added into the venv.

Default mode is **manual**: it listens and serves the UI but never transmits.
For the full loop change `launcher manual` to `launcher auto` in
`rhodep-pwnagotchi.service`. The NetHunter Pro app does this with a systemd
drop-in (`.../rhodep-pwnagotchi.service.d/10-mode.conf`) rather than editing the
unit, so a package upgrade does not fight it.

## The trap that will reboot your phone

pwnagotchi's `set_name()` rewrites `/etc/hostname` and **reboots the whole
machine** whenever `main.name` differs from the current hostname — and
`main.name` is read from `default.toml`, where it is `"pwnagotchi"`, so simply
leaving it out of your config does not help: it reboots towards "pwnagotchi".

`install.sh` pins `main.name` to the device's current hostname so the check is a
no-op and nothing is ever renamed or rebooted. During bring-up here it did fire
once and changed the hostname from `kali` to `pwnagotchi` before this was
understood; the installer sets it correctly, but if you edit the config by hand,
keep `main.name` equal to `hostname` or expect a reboot.

## Adapters: single- and dual-band

Either TP-Link works, and monstart is driver-agnostic (it drives `wlan1` by name
and phy, not by chipset), so nothing here changes between them:

- **RTL8188EUS** (single-band 2.4 GHz) — the `rtl8188eus` driver, see
  `packages/rhodep-rtl8188eus-fix`.
- **RTL8811AU / Archer T2U Nano** (dual-band 2.4 + 5 GHz) — the `rtw88` driver
  (`rtw_8821au`), see `packages/rhodep-rtl8821au`. With this one, add the 5 GHz
  channels to `personality.channels` in the config to actually hop them; the
  non-DFS channels (36-48, 149-165) are the useful ones, since DFS channels are
  `no-IR` and cannot transmit assoc/deauth. Confirmed hopping 5 GHz and seeing
  APs on channels 40/149/153.

## Web UI feel (apply-ui-fixes.sh)

The web frame is a PNG pwnagotchi re-saves per update; with the stock
`ui.fps = 0` it is written only on major state changes, so the "waiting Ns"
countdown never ticks and the whole thing feels static. Setting `ui.fps = 2` in
the config (device-side) starts the periodic refresh so it animates. To match
it, `apply-ui-fixes.sh` lowers the browser poll in `index.html` from 1000 ms to
500 ms, and moves the `APS` widget from x=28 to x=38 so three-digit 5 GHz
channel numbers do not overlap the label. Those two touch `/opt/pwnagotchi`
(third-party source), so `install.sh` reapplies them; re-run after any
pwnagotchi update.

## Notes

- Needs the TP-Link powered, which means USB-host + VBUS: `otg on` first
  (`rhodep-usb-otg`). monstart calls `otg on` itself if wlan1 is absent, but the
  adapter has to be physically plugged in.
- The internal wlan0 keeps working as your normal WiFi the entire time, so you
  can SSH in over it (or over the USB cable) while pwnagotchi runs.
- This is not held or protected like the core port packages — it is an
  extra-tool, optional, and lives entirely under /opt/pwnagotchi,
  /usr/local/sbin and /etc/pwnagotchi.
