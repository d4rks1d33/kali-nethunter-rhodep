"""Advertising engine: drives the radio in a background thread.

The original port did a "live update" of the advertising payload as fast
as it could (~57 Hz at 20 ms interval): the radio was left in
Advertise_Enable=1 the whole time and Set_Advertising_Data was rewritten
in place. That is what the HCI spec allows, and it works on Intel/CSR
adapters -- but the Qualcomm WCN399x that sits on this phone is not
happy about it. Its firmware ring buffers between the LE controller and
the host command queue overflow after a few thousand payload swaps and
the chip wedges: it stops answering HCI, and short of a `serdev
unbind/bind` the only thing that brings it back is a reboot.

The Android app the packet catalogue was ported from does not run into
this because its default rate is **1 s per payload**, not 20 ms; and
every payload swap goes through mgmt add_advertising / remove_advertising
which under the hood cycles Set_Advertise_Enable(false) → Set_Data →
Set_Advertise_Enable(true). So the fix here is to imitate that pattern:

  * `advertising_interval_ms` is the radio-level parameter (how often
    the chip retransmits a payload once it is loaded). Stays reasonable
    -- 100 ms by default.
  * `payload_change_ms` is the host-level loop (how often WE swap the
    payload). Default 200 ms (5 Hz), tunable up to whatever, but
    clamped down to sane values with a warning if the user asks for
    <100 ms.
  * every swap does the full disable → set_data → enable dance.
  * we listen for HCI_HARDWARE_ERROR events (0x10) and, if the chip
    starts spitting COMMAND_DISALLOWED (0x0C) at us more than a couple
    of times in a row, we back off exponentially instead of hammering.

None of these individually is a spec change -- we're still speaking
plain legacy LE advertising to the chip. They are just cooperative
patterns that keep the firmware queue healthy indefinitely.
