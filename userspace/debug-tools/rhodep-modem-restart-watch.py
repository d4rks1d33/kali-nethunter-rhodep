"""Crash the modem on purpose and watch what the bring-up does to the SoC.

Two runs of the glink hammer put the reset about four seconds after the modem
finished recovering, not when it died:

    [125.16] the edge went down, rproc=crashed
    [125.45] rproc crashed -> offline
    [130.74] rproc offline -> running
             ... SoC reset within the next few seconds

and the one time recovery hung forever inside ipa_modem_stop, the SoC was
never reset at all. So the suspicion is that it is the modem coming back up
that kills the machine, not the modem dying. If that holds, the hammer is not
needed: crashing the modem through debugfs is enough, and the whole experiment
takes fifteen seconds with no SIM and no radio.

Every line is fsync'd and echoed to /dev/kmsg before the next sample, because
the reset erases anything merely written. The last line is the answer.
