# Run as root, on the phone or inside the build chroot.
#
# Why this is worth having, beyond convenience: **the modem cannot be restarted
# without dropping WiFi**, because the WLAN protection domain lives inside it.
# Any work on the modem therefore has to happen over a link that does not depend
# on the modem, and the USB gadget is the only one. Debugging the modem over
# WiFi means losing the connection at the exact moment something interesting
# happens.
#
# The gadget itself already exists (ncm.usb0, which Linux, macOS and Windows 10+
# all support natively). What is missing on a stock Kali rootfs is any address
# on usb0: NetworkManager treats it as an ordinary wired interface and sits
# there asking for DHCP from a machine that is not offering any, so the
# interface stays up with no IPv4 and nothing answers on 172.16.42.1.
